# Predictors of hospitalization among men and women with CHF
Introduction
Heart failure is a clinical syndrome characterized by symptoms and signs of increased 
tissue or organ fluid retention and decreased tissue or organ perfusion. With an aging 
population, its prevalence continues to increase worldwide with high rates of morbidity and 
mortality, leading to enormous human, social, and economic costs.
As a major health threat to women and men, particularly at old age, studies have shown 
that some of the most profound sex differences in cardiovascular medicine are found in heart 
failure. These differences in sex in the presentation of heart failure have been found to play 
an important role in the progression of the disease, the development of relevant prognostic 
comorbidities, and even in response to therapies. As recently reviewed, the age-adjusted rates for
hospitalizations due to heart failure has increased significantly in the past decade for women, but 
not for men. In terms of risk of hospitalization and re-hospitalization, women with heart 
failure have been described as higher than or similar to those in men. Overall, despite 
common risk factors, the differences in sex continue to impact and inform targeted interventions 
and clinical outcomes for men and women with heart failure.
Considering this, the objective of this study is to determine independent predictors of 
hospitalization due to worsening heart failure among men and women with heart failure using the
Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) clinical trial dataset
